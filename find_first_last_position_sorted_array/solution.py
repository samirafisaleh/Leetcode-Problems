    NAME:
    Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

    If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

    CONSTRAINTS:
    1. 0 <= nums.length <= 105
    2. -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
    3. nums is a non-decreasing array.
    4. -109 <= target <= 109

    EXAMPLES:
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
    Output: [3,4]

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
    Output: [-1,-1]

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [], target = 0
    Output: [-1,-1]
